The official Shark App(name temporary) Repository


What is the Shark App?

Shark Researchers accross the globe continue to use inept and outdated data capture methods, such as the old clipboard and pencil. Furthermore, when considering the rough conditions common to the raging sea, the potential for data obfuscation becomes palpable. Shark App seeks to alleviate these problems by giving researchers a centralized and automated system to store data in. Shark App manages timers along with a plethora of other information in it's current state, and gives users the opportunity to upload their data into an automated spreadsheet.



Why Shark App?

We are the only app on the market providing this service and we are currently only working on this project, which translates to full attention to our customers.



What are we currently working on?(This section will update once a week)

Recently we have made many quality of life improvements on the base app in order to prepare it for major UI and back-end changes. 

The implemented changes include:

-Hook deletion: Now users can delete a specific hook
-Hook selection on creation: If a user adds a hook, this hook will automatically be displayed
-Hook clearance on export: Hook's will now automatically clear on export rather than completely restarting the app
-Efficient export operation: Exporting used to throw an error due to permission conflicts, which would in turn lag the app. This has been patched

Changes we plan to implement next:

-Hook insertion: The ability to delete and reinsert a hook at a specified location. This should help preserve any specified order that the user wants to create
-Pop-Up on export: Throw a pop-up confirming that the user would like to export. If a user accidnetally presses the export button in the current state of the app, all data is wiped from the app



Plans for the future:

1. Add a live database
2. Add a live map of tagged sharks
